Add tests functions here. Functions should return true for a passed test; any other value will be converted to string for the failure log.

This means you can write a test line like:
    return str == "happyFactor" || str;
and if the str isn't the expected "happyFactor" you can see what it is in the log instead of just "false".


CAVEAT-EMPTOR : if your alternate return value's toString is *also* equivalent to "true" you'll get false negatives.
