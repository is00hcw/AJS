<h3> Welcome to AUI Sandbox </h3>
This sandbox tool will help you become acquainted with the AUI API and allow you to experiment with the different components available in AUI.
<p>
To use the tool you may click on any of the component buttons on the blue toolbar to generate the recommended markup and javascript that is needed to implement that component.  You can then edit the markup, javascript and css of the implementation in the editors in the top section of the tool.
<p> 
    The results of the implementation is displayed in the "display" box to the bottom left.
<p>
Information for each component can be found by hovering over each component button.

Further information on how to use the API can be found in the AUI Documentation: <a href="http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/AUI/"> AUI Documentation </a>
